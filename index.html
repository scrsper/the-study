        <h3>The Trinity</h3>
        <p>
            One day at a local arboretum in the Summer of 2024 my friend D and I were walking among the groomed
            landscaping discussing Christian history and sharing thoughts about our shared beliefs. I had brought up
            some recent thoughts of mine that I had been ruminating on for the past several months. It had stemmed from 
            YouTube videos and subsequent articles which focused on the ancient God YHWH and the ancient Canaanite gods.
            From this I had been thinking about the idea of the Elohim being a group of beings, lesser than the One True God,
            but potentially misconstrued as "gods" by ancient civilizations as they might have been beings of power in
            their own right. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The traditional understanding of the word Elohim by Christians is considered a singular word referencing 
            YHWH. I was watching a video where Graham Hancock was interviewing a man whoe had translated the traditional 
            Hebrew Bible into Enlgish and the guest was talking about this word Elohim as a geammatically plural use in the 
            multiple isntances of the Bible. This opinion of his sent my brain down a rabbit hole of supposition. "Could
            this be the case?", I thought. Was there a potential for these seemingly unrelated videos and articles that I had
            been exposed to been a coincidence? I don't think things are coincidental, I believe The Father has his hand in 
            everything in life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, from this the gears in my brain started turning. Could these ancient Canaanite gods be early memories of these
            ancient Elohim. Could it be that The Father Almighty created "lesser gods" to make up his "Divine Council" that is 
            mentioned theiughout the Bible? This certainly makes for an entertaining idea. So i continued on with it, letting it dance
            through my mind for weeks and months building into fantasies that woukd occupy my mind and my time, obviously distracting
            me from my day to day activities and annoying my friends and my lover to no end.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, on that summer day wlaking in the garden explaining these thoughts to my friend D, he turned to me and stated
            something I had never heard before. Now, he had been theough seminary school and he frequented his church much more
            than I had in the last several years and his Biblical and religious knowledge is more refined than my own. His formal
            background was a contrast to my journalistic approach to finding the truth behind the words on the pages of the book
            I believe is foundational to my faith. After all, the words of Jesus Christ are brasthed through the Bible. Nevertheless,
            D turned to me and said, "The idea of the Holy Trinity, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit being One being
            with Three distinct persons, is an inferred position on the nature of God."
        </p>
        <p>
            In that moment it was as if I was struck by something, because if what he said were true, then that meant that the truth that
            I had been told all this time was not actually a truth, but an inferred opinion on what the Bible decribed the nature of God. 
            This would make sense as to why the explaination of why Jesus and the Father have a paradoxical relationship in the Chrsitian
            tradition, as they are considered to be both the same and different beings simitaneously. I always attributed this
            to "the mysterious nature of God", but if there was now the possibility that they were not just the same entity, but two distinct
            entities, then things start to get really interesting. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "But of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only." Matthew 24:36 states that no one knows
            when the Father will send Jesus to get his followers in His final coming, implying that not even Jesus knows. This implied that there are
            two separate entities in Jesus Christ and God the Father. In my mind, that gives more substance to the relationship between them; that 
            the Father truly gave up His distinct Son to live as a man and die for the redemptikb of sin in a willing sacrifice. This 
            also testifies to the staggeringly hard choice that Jesus needed to make in obeying the will of the Father out
            of love for all of us. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My supposition on the traditional Holy Trinity does not discount the love that the Father had for his children and for His Son
            and does not discount the sacrifice that tbe Son went through to give us the Holy Spirit, the power of the Father. If anything
            is strangthens my faith and understanding of God, not in a paradoxical or mysterious way, but in a way that
            emphasizes this story of truth, justice, and love of a Creator and his creation.
